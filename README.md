# RawNetworkDataPreProcessing


This repository contains Python code that applies the steps explained in the paper "Raw Network Traffic Data Preprocessing and Preparation for Automatic Analysis" which was published at this conference http://www.c-mric.com/ci2018

As explained in the paper, the data that was used can found here: http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/botnet.html

These steps were run using Anaconda Python 3.5

Observe that the PCAP data was downloaded from http://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/botnet.html and this Java package https://github.com/ISCX/ISCXFlowMeter was used to transform the PCAP data into CSV.
